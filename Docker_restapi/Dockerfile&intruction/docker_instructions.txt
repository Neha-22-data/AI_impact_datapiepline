# Docker Instructions for Running the Flask S3 API

## Prerequisites:
- Docker installed (restart the connect again after install)
- S3 bucket already created
- AWS credentials with S3 access configured (optional: mounted or set via env)(command given below)

## Steps:

1. Navigate to the folder containing the Dockerfile and your code:
   cd /path/to/your/project

2. Build the Docker image:
   docker build -t flask-s3-api .

3. Run the container:
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 flask-s3-api

4. Test the API:
   Use curl or browser to access:
   http://localhost:5000

5. Upload File Example:
   curl -X POST -F "file=@yourfile.csv" http://localhost:5000/upload

## Notes:
- Make sure the file `restapi.py` contains the Flask app with an `/upload` route that handles S3 upload logic.
- AWS credentials can be mounted inside the container if needed
